I'm a family man at heart. I have a beautiful wife and two darling girls (Ellie
and Charlie). We also have another little one on the way! I enjoy spending every
moment I can with my family. Together we enjoy camping, kayaking, gardening,
watching movies, and eating pizza. When I'm not with my family or working, I can
usually be found playing piano, cycling, playing basketball, or playing 
racquetball.

While my undergraduate degree is in Statistics and my graduate degree is in Data 
Science, I consider myself more of a software professional than anything else. 
I'm an avid R advocate, user, and developer. I work for [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
as a Solutions Engineer where I help enterprises integrate RStudio products into
their data environments. I also work on R packages, write for the [RViews 
blog](https://rviews.rstudio.com/), and work to create resources that will 
benefit the R community. I can be found on Twitter @
