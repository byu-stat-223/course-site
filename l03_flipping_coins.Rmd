```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Consider flipping `size` distinct coins. After each round, each coin that is tails
is flipped again. After `n_rounds`, where `n_rounds` is at least one, the proportion
of coins that are `heads` is computed. Answer these questions:

1. What is the expected number of heads?
2. What is the standard deviation of the number of heads?

In order to answer these questions, we'll build a function to help us simulate 
this scenario.

```{r}
flip_coins <- function(size = 64, n_rounds = 1) {
  if (n_rounds < 1) stop("n_rounds must be at least 1.")
  x <- sample(c("H", "T"), size = size, replace = TRUE)
  if (n_rounds > 1) {
    for (i in 2:n_rounds) {
      x[x == "T"] <- sample(c("H", "T"), size = sum(x == "T"), replace = TRUE)
    }
  }
  sum(x == "H")
}

flip_coins(n_rounds = 3)
```

How can we estimate the average number of heads and the standard deviation
associated with number of heads?  We can certainly use probability theory. An 
alternative approach is a Monte Carlo or simulation study.

```{r}
n_reps <- 1000
n_rounds <- 3
```

#### For Loop
```{r}
library(tictoc)

n_heads <- numeric(n_reps)
tic("For Loop")
for (i in seq_along(n_heads)) {
  n_heads[i] <- flip_coins(n_rounds = n_rounds)
}
toc()
```


#### sapply / replicate
```{r}
tic("sapply")
n_heads <- sapply(1:n_reps, function(x) flip_coins(n_rounds = n_rounds))
toc()

tic("replicate")
n_heads <- replicate(n_reps, flip_coins(n_rounds = n_rounds))
toc()
```

#### Tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tic("purrr")
n_heads <- rerun(n_reps, flip_coins(n_rounds = n_rounds)) %>% 
  unlist()
toc()
```

Now that we have the sampling distribution of the number of heads (`n_heads`), 
we can summarise it.

```{r}
plot(table(n_heads))
```

```{r}
table(n_heads) / length(n_heads)
```

```{r}
mean(n_heads)
sd(n_heads)
```

Is there uncertainty in these summaries? Yes! So, how do we understand and 
communicate those uncertainties? Well, we could just wrap our simulation inside
another simulation!

Now we're going to produce 1000 Monte Carlo estimates of the mean and standard
deviation.

```{r}
mc_estimates <- replicate(1000, {
  n_heads <- replicate(n_reps, flip_coins(n_rounds = 3))
  c(mean(n_heads), sd(n_heads))
})
dim(mc_estimates)
```

```{r}
mc_means <- mc_estimates[1,]
mc_sds <- mc_estimates[2,]
```


Now we can look at the distribution of our simulation estimates.

```{r}
hist(mc_means, main = "Mean")
```

```{r}
hist(mc_sds, main = "SD")
```

Now we can compute a 95% confidence interval for these estimates.

```{r}
quantile(mc_means, c(0.025, 0.975))
quantile(mc_sds, c(0.025, 0.975))
```

That worked!! But, it was exceptionally computationally intensive (1000 * 1000
simulations). Is there a better way to assess this uncertainty without going through
all of this? Yes! We can invoke the Central Limit Theorem. Since `n_reps` is large,
the CLT applies.

```{r}
simulation_ci <- function(x, confidence_level = 0.95) {
  n <- length(x)
  m <- mean(x)
  s <- sd(x)
  area <- 1 - (1 - confidence_level)/2
  m + c(-1, 1) * qt(area, df = n - 1) * s / sqrt(n)
}
```

The function above simply calculates a confidence interval by implementing:
$$
C.I. = \bar{x}\pm t_{\alpha/2} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean and $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and
$t_{\alpha/2}$ is the t distribution value for the desired confidence level $\alpha$.

```{r}
simulation_ci(n_heads)
sqrt(simulation_ci((n_heads - mean(n_heads))^2))
```

Now we have a way of assessing the simulation error without running an incredible
amount of simulations, and it's all thanks to the Central Limit Theorem.
