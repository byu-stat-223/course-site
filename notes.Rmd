*My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the 
wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep. He hath 
filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. He hath confounded 
mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me.*

*Considering the Savior’s great promise for peace in this life and eternal life 
in the life to come, discipleship is a price worth paying. It is a price we cannot 
afford not to pay. By measure, the requirements of discipleship are much, much 
less than the promised blessings.*

*The Lord is with us, mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do. Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord knew that at times we would feel fear. I have been there and so have you, which is why the scriptures are replete with the Lord’s counsel:
“Be of good cheer, and do not fear.”*

*Jesus provides the ultimate example of righteous responsiveness and willing submission as He suffered intense agony in Gethsemane.
“And when he was at the place, he said unto [His disciples], Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
“And he … kneeled down, and prayed,
“Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.”
The Savior’s meekness in this eternally essential and excruciating experience demonstrates for each of us the importance of putting the wisdom of God above our own wisdom.*

*Obedience opens the door to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. And 
the spiritual gifts and abilities activated by the power of the Holy Ghost enable 
us to avoid deception—and to see, to feel, to know, to understand, and to remember 
things as they really are. You and I have been endowed with a greater capacity for 
obedience precisely for these reasons.*

*I testify that his intelligence is vastly superior in every field to the very 
brightest mortals in those fields and that his intellect in scope and truth far 
exceeds all human intellects. I thank him for encapsulating that exquisite mind 
in both perfect love and perfect humility. His brilliance is not the 
“catch-me-if-you-can” kind, but a pleading and patient, “Come, follow me.”*
