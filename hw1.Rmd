```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

+ Make sure your laptop is setup (install git, R, and RStudio)

+ Use [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/wMFYyzeu) to create your hw1
repository on GitHub

+ Without changing the names, add all the files in [this
repository](https://github.com/byu-stat-223/stat223-hw1) to your HW1 repository.

+ Modify the R scripts to produce the requested results.  Remember to use the
[coding standards](coding-standards.html).

+ In a script named `fib.R`, write an function named `fib` whose sole input is an
integer (say `n`) and whose output is a vector containing the first n Fibonacci
numbers (every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones
and the first two numbers are 1).

+ Commit your work to your HW1 repository and push these updated files to
your online GitHub repository. **Remember that HW is not submitted until it is
successfully pushed to GitHub.**
